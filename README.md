The Museum-2 landing page was created for the NAMU. It contains information about current events (exhibitions) of the museum, a gallery with paintings of the museum, the opportunity to subscribe to current events of the museum and its contacts.

The landing page was created according to [Figma design](https://www.figma.com/file/HL3XGt5ZatvJoYBhOaWY5x/museum-prototype?type=design&node-id=323-1957&mode=design&t=rRGdlsLcWM616gbS-0).

When creating the landing page, i used HTML, SCSS, BEM. 

That is my [DEMO LINK](https://teerveet.github.io/museum-2-landing/).
